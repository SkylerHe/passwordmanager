## Project Proposal

This project is a simple and accessible distributed password manager that will give access to the user via API from any computer. It intends to securely store, generate and retrieve a user's password. One of the most prominent issues is that passwords are often stolen, brute-forced and guessed by attackers. Users, too, make it easier on the attackers by reusing their passwords or creating passwords that are comprised of ordinary strings, such as 'p@$$word22'. Our application will help generate passwords that are hard to guess, that are stored securely and that are easily retrieved.
